# D3-Challenge



In this exercise I created a data visualization for a major metro paper.  

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/).  The current data  set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state.  MOE stands for "margin of error."

I created a scatter plot between two of the data variables `Smokers vs. Poverty` that represents each state with circle elements.
